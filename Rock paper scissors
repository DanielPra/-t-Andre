# Create a rock paper scissors game

# If split game loop and start over.

# Stop printing "correct input"

# create def function to check for correct answer

# The simplest way to accomplish this would be to put the input method in a while
# loop. Use continue when you get bad input, and break out of the loop when
# you're satisfied.
